# Sales Tax Calculator

Calculates the tax by the items provided depending if it is taxable,non taxable or has an import tax.

What i did in this application is pretty much straight forward. I did the class and method following the basic rules.

The method product_information will accept a hash array/list of items that the test will send. assuming this application is real life that is why i have chosen a hash object.

I only applies positive test here no negative test.

To test just go inside the folder "sales_taxes_app" and run "rspec spec/lib/sales_taxes_spec.rb"
